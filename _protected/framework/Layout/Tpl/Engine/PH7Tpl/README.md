# 🎨 pH7Tpl 🖌️

## 🔭 Summary

**[pH7](https://github.com/pH-7)'s Template Engine** gives a readable syntax inspired from Smarty and some random language syntaxes I have seen during my degree in 2009.

**pH7Tpl** has been built to give as much freedom as possible for either developers or designers.


## 📖 The Syntaxes

pH7Tpl supports two different syntaxes:

1. "*Curly*" looks slightly similar to Smarty syntax.
2. "*TAL (Template Attribute Language)*" is inspired from XSLT/XML syntax, but simplified and easier to use.


## 💨 Built to be the FASTEST 🌠

It translates all high-level code into PHP, then save it until the .tpl file is modified.

When the tpl "view" files are compiled into PHP code, pH7Tpl also optimizes the PHP code, removes extra open/close PHPtags, strips all comments and compacts the code.

Finally, pH7Tpl gives an output static cache for non-dynamic pages.

In short, without template engines (with only raw PHP code as template language), your website would be even slower than using pH7Tpl.
